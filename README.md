## General introduction
Microbial community structure and diversity, and population structure are fundamental aspects to understand evolution, niche adaptation and demographic history of bacterial species. As NGS sequencing has become cost effective and accessible, sequencing populations of bacteria across the whole genome provides unprecedented resolution to investigate within-host evolution, transmission history, and population structure. Moreover, analysis of genetic content of microbial communities through metagenomics has become the mainstream methodology. During the one week course the students will learn and apply bioinformatic techniques to perform population genetics and study microbial communities with metagenomic approaches. The goal is to become familiar with the bioinformatic analysis tools and to be able to utilize them in own research after the course.

**Everything is possible thanks to the support of [CSC](http://www.csc.fi)**

## Schedule
The course will be held in Viikki at the Faculty of Agriculture and Forestry, University of Helsinki.  
Place: __Info Centre Korona, room Info4, 1st Floor__
