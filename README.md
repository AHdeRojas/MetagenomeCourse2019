# Metagenomics

## General introduction
Microbial community structure and diversity, and population structure are fundamental aspects to understand evolution, niche adaptation and demographic history of bacterial species. As NGS sequencing has become cost effective and accessible, sequencing populations of bacteria across the whole genome provides unprecedented resolution to investigate within-host evolution, transmission history, and population structure. Moreover, analysis of genetic content of microbial communities through metagenomics has become the mainstream methodology. During the one week course the students will learn and apply bioinformatic techniques to perform population genetics and study microbial communities with metagenomic approaches. The goal is to become familiar with the bioinformatic analysis tools and to be able to utilize them in own research after the course.

## Target group
This course is targeted at PhD and MSc students who are interested in performing bacterial population analysis using whole-genome sequencing and/or using metagenomics for investigating microbial communities.

## Learning outcomes
Microbial genomics: QA/QC of the raw sequence data, cleaning and assembly; Gene-by-gene annotation; Genealogy reconstruction and population structure analysis; Visualization of data; GWAS and comparative analysis; Microbial metagenomics: quality control, filtering and assembly to taxonomic classification, clustering, functional assignment, analyses of microbial community composition and comparative metagenomics
